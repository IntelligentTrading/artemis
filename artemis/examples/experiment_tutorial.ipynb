    "\n",
    "1. Come up with a hypothesis.\n",
    "2. Create an experiment to test this hypothesis\n",
    "3. Run experiment, observe, record results.\n",
    "4. Given results, either celebrate, or return to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "All too often, what we actually do is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Come up with hypothesis\n",
    "2. Create an experiment to test this hypothesis\n",
    "3. Run, experiment, observe results.\n",
    "4. Be somehow unsatisfied with results, change some parameter in experiment.\n",
    "5. Run experiment again with new parameters.\n",
    "6. Observe results again, remain unsatisfied, revert to step 5 several times.\n",
    "7. Get tired of waiting for experiments to run just to analyze results.  Start saving results of experiments, so they can be loaded an analyzed at any time.\n",
    "8. Run several experiments, load and compare results.\n",
    "9. Realize we've forgotten which parameters correspond to which results.\n",
    "10. Try to run all experiments again and save their results, this time keeping track of their parameters, but realize we've forgotten the parameters we used in our first experiments.  \n",
    "11. Eventually get to some result, resolve to be more organized the next time around.\n",
    "12. Repeat from step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Artemis Experiment Framework aims to help organize this process.  It does this with the following functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recording Experimental Results**: The framework captures the console output, plots, and results of an experiment so that we can review them later without having to run the experiment again.  \n",
    "2. **Creating Variations on Experiments**: The framework allows us to define variants on experiments by changing some parameter.  This allows up to build and maintain a list of variations on our experiment, and the results of running these variations.\n",
    "3. **Comparing Experiments**: Using the saved results of each experiment, Artemis allows us to easily go back and compare the results of different experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate these in the following tutorial."
